It allows you to ask alexa for movie recommendations, using actors, directors and other movies as a reference.
## Usage

It's for free on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/rrriki-movie-freak/dp/B07KMZ3NFK/), just enable it on your Alexa powered device by saying "**Alexa enable Movie Freak**"

 - Alexa, tell movie freak to recommend me a Christopher Nolan Movie.
